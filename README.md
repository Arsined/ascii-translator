# Running
It is best to run using cmd. You can pass part of the window title to the arguments, just "google" or "youtube" will be enough. Or you can enter the title in the code. <br />
If you want to run via PyCharm, you should enable terminal emulation. It's not a fact that everything will work perfectly.

# Description
#### Works only for windows
Can translate to ascii lol
The average output "fps" is 20-30 depending on the screen size and the number of illuminated pixels.
The code takes into account the fact that not all colors are equally bright.

# Running
It is best to run using cmd. You can pass part of the window title to the arguments, just "google" or "youtube" will be enough. Or you can enter the title in the code.
If you want to run via PyCharm, you should enable terminal emulation. It's not a fact that everything will work perfectly.
